/*
 * This header declares routines for serial communication between
 * any two endpoints.
 *
 * The mode used is 8N1, 8 bit character size, no parity and 1 stop bit.
 * All messages are fixed size of 4 bytes in network byte order, i.e. big endian.
 * Every message is followed by a checksum byte, a simple sum of message bytes.
 * If on receive the checksum is correct, an ACKNOWLEDGE byte (255) is sent back.
 * If the checksum is incorrect, a NEGATIVE_ACKNOWLEDGE byte (0) is sent back.
 * If an error occurs with an acknowledge byte, assume values greater than 127
 * to be ACKNOWLEDGE, and less than or equal to 127 to be NEGATIVE_ACKNOWLEDGE.
 * On negative acknowledge, the message is resent up to ATTEMPTS_BEFORE_ABORT (3) times.
 * If all attempts fail, the communication should abort and throw an error.
 *
 * Both sides of the communication should include this header, and implement
 * the port_init, port_end, bytes_write, bytes_read
 * specific to their platform. You can then use serial_send and
 * serial_receive functions that perform the communication.
